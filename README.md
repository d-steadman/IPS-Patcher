# IPS Patcher

IPS Patcher is a small script for applying valid IPS patches to binary files. 

### Usage

Using this tool is very simple:


  'patcher.py <patch> <file> <output>'


Optional arguments include -v and -h for verbosity and help respectively.

### Information

The way this program is coded, the original binary file is preserved and an entirely new patched file is created.
